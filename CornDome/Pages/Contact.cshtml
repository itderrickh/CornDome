    <p>
        I am Derrick, a software engineer with a passion for card games and an enjoyer of nerdy things.
        Primarily a Pokemon TCG player, I have grown bored of the competitive format and started playing other games on the side.
    </p>
    <p>
        My boredom of standard format led me down a rabbit hole and while scrolling through social media I saw an ad for the Adventure Time Card Wars kickstarter project.
        I played this card game about a decade ago with my best pal Brandon and forgot about it for 10 years of activities including:
        attending college, getting married, and buying my first home.
    </p>
    <p>
        So I did what any sane card game enjoyer software developer would do. Make a fun website for it!
